        <h2>Option 1: Legislative power</h2>
    </div>
    <p> <b>
            Taking legislative action is the only way that we can truly stop companies from taking our data. To find
            your legislator, look up "Find Your Legislator" and the state that you're located in. From there, you can
            find a
            legislator's contact information. Take five minutes and email your legislator about company data collection,
            and why we need to put an end to it.
            <br>
            <br>
            Here are are some tips for drafting your letter or email:</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
                1. Be polite.
                <br>
                --------------------------------------
                <br>
                <br>
                - Rude or entitled language is not likely to get a response. Your best approach is to be respectful of
                their position as an elected official. Also, when addressing a letter use the phrase “Representative
                (Last Name)” or “Senator (Last Name).”
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                2. Be in-district.
                <br>
                --------------------------------------
                <br>
                <br>
                -While some politicians have their own issues that you both find important, they will be more receptive
                to people within their districts. Their job is to represent the people within their district. If you
                live in Kentucky, you can locate your state representative via this link: 
                <a href="https://apps.legislature.ky.gov/findyourlegislator/findyourlegislator.html" style="color: white">Find Your Legislator</a>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                3. Be straightforward.
                <br>
                --------------------------------------
                <br>
                <br>
                -Add a subject line or letterhead to the beginning to briefly state your position. For example, “Support
                HB 301,” (NCRA, 2023).
                <br>
                <br>
                -Make your arguments quickly and concisely. Long explanations take time to read, time that busy
                legislators and aides do not have. Plan for a single-page letter (NCRA, 2023).
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                4. Be unique.
                <br>
                --------------------------------------
                <br>
                <br>
                -Especially at the local level, politicians represent fewer constituents. They will be more receptive to
                your voice. Write your letter personally, in your style. If they receive a mass of pre-written letters,
                they will discard them.
                <br>
                <br>
                -Briefly share your personal connection to the issue. People connect with stories, not data (NCRA, 2023).
                <br>
                <br>
                -Sign your letter in your own handwriting to add a more personal touch (NCRA, 2023).
                <br>
